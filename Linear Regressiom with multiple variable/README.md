# Linear Regression with Multiple dependent variables
Two notebooks Trial implementation and Multiple linear regression are released. Trial notebook is my own implementation without use of any library for preprocessing whereas other notebook uses sklearn for preprocessing. The difference is each categorial feature is expanded to one hot enocding in multiple linear regression notebook which results in more number of features and better accuracy.
